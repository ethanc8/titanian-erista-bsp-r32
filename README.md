# Titanian Board Support Package for Tegra X1 "Erista"

This repository holds a copy of the [Jetson Linux r32.7.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/linux-tegra-r3274) Board Support Package for the Jetson Nano (4GB), the Jetson Nano 2GB, and the Jetson TX1.

All tarballs files have been extracted and the original tarballs deleted with the `extract_tarballs.sh` script, but this is an otherwise pristine copy of the BSP.
